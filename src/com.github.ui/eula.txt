			PRIVACY NOTICES

The Software automatically communicates with GitHub servers for two purposes: (1) sending error reports; and (2) sending anonymized usage data so we may improve the Software.

You may opt out of sending the anonymized usage data, but if you do not want the Software to send error reports, you must uninstall the Software.

 1. ERROR REPORTS. In order to help us improve the Software, when the
     Software encounters certain errors, it will automatically send some
     information to GitHub about the error (as described at the URL
     above).
     This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to send error
     reports to GitHub, you must uninstall the Software.

 2. ANONYMIZED USAGE DATA. GitHub collects anonymized data about
     your usage of the Software to help us make it more awesome.
     Approximately once a day the Software sends such data
     (as described in more detail at the URL above) to GitHub's servers.
     If you do not want to send anonymized usage data to GitHub,
     you may opt out by changing your settings in the
     Settings dialog under the GitHub dialog.
