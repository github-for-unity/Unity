# Contributing to GitHub for Unity

## Build Requirements

This repository is LFS-enabled. To clone it, you should use a git client that supports git LFS 2.x and submodules.

### Windows

- Visual Studio 2015+ or Mono 4.x + bash shell (git bash).
  - Mono 5.x will not work
- `UnityEngine.dll` and `UnityEditor.dll`.
  - If you've installed Unity in the default location of `C:\Program Files\Unity` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity`, the build will be able to reference these DLLs automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to copy these DLLs from `[Unity installation path]\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed` into the `lib` directory in order for the build to work

### MacOS

- Mono 4.x required.
  - Mono 5.x will not work
- `UnityEngine.dll` and `UnityEditor.dll`.
  - If you've installed Unity in the default location of `/Applications/Unity`, the build will be able to reference these DLLs automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to copy these DLLs from `[Unity installation path]/Unity.app/Contents/Managed` into the `lib` directory in order for the build to work

## How to Build

Clone the repository and its submodules in a git GUI client that supports Git LFS, or via the command line with the following command:

```
git lfs clone https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity
```

*Note*: git might complain that it can't checkout the `script` submodule. That submodule is not required for normal builds and you can ignore the error,
or run the following to stop it complaining:

```
git submodule deinit script
```

### Important pre-build steps

To be able to authenticate in GitHub for Unity, you'll need to:

- [Register a new developer application](https://github.com/settings/developers) in your profile.
- Copy [common/ApplicationInfo_Local.cs-example](../../common/ApplicationInfo_Local.cs-example) to `common/ApplicationInfo_Local.cs` and fill out the clientId/clientSecret fields for your application.

The build needs to reference `UnityEngine.dll` and `UnityEditor.dll`. These DLLs are included with Unity. If you've installed Unity in the default location, the build will be able to find them automatically. If not, copy these DLLs from `[your Unity installation path]\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed` into the `lib` directory in order for the build to work.

### Visual Studio

To build with Visual Studio 2015+, open the solution file `GitHub.Unity.sln`. Select `Build Solution` in the `Build` menu.

### Mono and Bash (windows and mac)

To build with Mono 4.x and Bash execute `build.sh` in a bash shell.

## Build Output

Once you've built the solution for the first time, you can open `src/UnityExtension` in Unity. This folder contains the `GitHub.Unity` project and all the Unity UI and other Unity-specific code that you can have Unity compile as normal for quick testing and prototyping.

The build also creates a Unity test project called `GitHubExtension` inside a directory called `github-unity-test` next to your local clone. For instance, if the repository is located at `c:\Projects\Unity` the test project will be at `c:\Projects\github-unity-test\GitHubExtension`. You can use this project to test binary builds of the extension in a clean environment (all needed DLLs will be copied to it every time you build).

Note: some files might be locked by Unity if have one of the build output projects open when you compile from VS or the command line. This is expected and shouldn't cause issues with your builds. 

## Solution organization

The `GitHub.Unity.sln` solution includes several projects:

- dotnet-httpclient35 and octokit: external dependencies for threading and github api support, respectively. These are the submodules.
- packaging: empty projects with build rules that copy DLLs to various locations for testing
- Tests: unit and integration test projects
- GitHub.Logging: A logging helper library
- GitHub.Api: The core of the extension. This project is C#6 and includes async/await threading and other features that Unity cannot currently compile.
- GitHub.Unity: Unity-specific code. This project is compilable by Unity

## Other solutions

Octokit is normally included as a prebuilt DLL (in the `lib` directory), but when updating Octokit or debugging issues with the 3.5 backport, it can sometimes be handy to reference the project directly. The `GitHub.Unity.OctokitDebugging.sln` solution is a helper solution that includes Octokit and dotnet-httpclient35 as referenced projects instead of prebuilt dlls.

This solution requires a clone of [https://github.com/github-for-unity/octokit.net](https://github.com/github-for-unity/octokit.net) and [https://github.com/github-for-unity/dotnet-httpclient35](https://github.com/github-for-unity/dotnet-httpclient35) to exist next to your GitHub for Unity checkout.
