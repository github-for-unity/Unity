:+1: :tada: :sparkling_heart: Thanks for your interest! :sparkling_heart: :tada: :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to GitHub for Unity and its
related projects, which are hosted in the [GitHub for Unity Organization](https://github.com/github-for-unity)
on GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Note that GitHub for Unity is currently a public alpha, so everything is likely to
change over time as we learn and refine how we work with the community.

### Up For Grabs

As the team is working towards the 1.0 release, we'll identify enhancements or
bugs that can be categorized as tasks that:

 - have low impact, or have a known workaround
 - should be fixed
 - have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
 - can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labelled as [`up-for-grabs`](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/labels/up-for-grabs)
in the repository. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please
comment on the issue to let the maintainers (and community) know you are
interested in picking this up.
