## Notices

Please refer to the [list of known issues](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug), and make sure you have backups of your work before trying it out.

From version 0.19 onwards, the location of the plugin has moved to `Assets/Plugins/GitHub`. If you have version 0.18 or lower, you need to delete the `Assets/Editor/GitHub` folder before you install newer versions. You should exit Unity and delete the folder from Explorer/Finder, as Unity will not unload native libraries while it's running. Also, remember to update your `.gitignore` file.
