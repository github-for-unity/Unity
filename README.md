## Notices

This software is currently alpha quality. Please refer to the [list of known issues](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug), and make sure you have backups of your work before trying it out.

From version 0.19 onwards, the location of the plugin has moved to `Assets/Plugins/GitHub`. If you have version 0.18 or lower, you need to delete the `Assets/Editor/GitHub` folder before you install newer versions. You should exit Unity and delete the folder from Explorer/Finder, as Unity will not unload native libraries while it's running. Also, remember to update your `.gitignore` file.

## Installing GitHub for Unity

### Requirements

- Unity 5.4 or higher
   - There's currently an blocker issue opened for 5.3 support, so we know it doesn't run there. Personal edition is fine.
- Git and Git LFS 2.x

#### Git on macOS

The current release has limited macOS support. macOS users will need to install the latest [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) manually, and make sure these are on the path. You can configure the Git location in the Settings tab on the GitHub window.

The easiest way of installing git and git lfs is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then do `brew install git git-lfs`.

Make sure a Git user and email address are set in the `~/.gitconfig` file before you initialize a repository for the first time. You can set these values by opening your `~/.gitconfig` file and adding the following section, if it doesn't exist yet:

```
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = Your Email
```

#### Git on Windows

The GitHub for Unity extension ships with a bundle of Git and Git LFS, to ensure that you have the correct version. These will be installed into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubUnity` when the extension runs for the first time.

Make sure a Git user and email address are set in the `%HOME%\.gitconfig` file before you initialize a repository for the first time. You can set these values by opening your `%HOME%\.gitconfig`  file and adding the following section, if it doesn't exist yet:

```
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = Your Email
```

Once the extension is installed, you can open a command line with the same Git and Git LFS version that the extension uses by going to `Window` -> `GitHub Command Line` in Unity.

### Installation

This extensions needs to be installed (and updated) for each Unity project that you want to version control. 
First step is to download the latest package from [the releases page](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/releases);
it will be saved as a file with the extension `.unitypackage`.
To install it, open Unity, then open the project you want to version control, and then double click on the downloaded package.
Alternatively, import the package by clicking Assets, Import Package, Custom Package, then select the downloaded package.

#### Log files

##### macOS

he extension log file can be found at `~/Library/Application Support/GitHubUnity/github-unity.log`

##### Windows

The extension log file can be found at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubUnity\github-unity.log`

## Quick Guide to GitHub for Unity

### Opening the GitHub window

You can access the GitHub window by going to Windows -> GitHub. The window opens by default next to the Inspector window.

### Initialize Repository

![Initialize repository screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103121/37807041-bb4446a6-2e19-11e8-9fff-a431309b8515.png)

If the current Unity project is not in a Git repository, the GitHub for Unity extension will offer to initialize the repository for you. This will:

- Initialize a git repository at the Unity project root via `git init`
- Initialize git-lfs via `git lfs install`
- Set up a `.gitignore` file at the Unity project root.
- Set up a `.gitattributes` file at the Unity project root with a large list of known binary filetypes (images, audio, etc) that should be tracked by LFS
- Configure the project to serialize meta files as text
- Create an initial commit with the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` file.

### Authentication

To set up credentials in Git so you can push and pull, you can sign in to GitHub by going to `Window` -> `GitHub` -> `Account` -> `Sign in`. You only have to sign in successfully once, your credentials will remain on the system for all Git operations in Unity and outside of it. If you've already signed in once but the Account dropdown still says `Sign in`, ignore it, it's a bug.

### Publish a new repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new empty repository - do not add a license, readme or other files during the creation process.
2. Copy the **https** URL shown in the creation page
3. In Unity, go to `Windows` -> `GitHub` -> `Settings` and paste the url into the `Remote` textbox.
3. Click `Save repository`.
4. Go to the `History` tab and click `Push`.

### Commiting your work - Changes tab

You can see which files have been changed and commit them through the Changes tab. `.meta` files will show up in relation to their files on the tree, so you can select a file for comitting and automatically have their `.meta` 

![Changes tab screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/27644933-ab00af72-5bd9-11e7-84c3-edec495f87f5.png)

### Pushing/pulling your work - History tab

The history tab includes a `Push` button to push your work to the server. Make sure you have a remote url configured in the `Settings` tab so that you can push and pull your work.

To receive updates from the server by clicking on the `Pull` button. You cannot pull if you have local changes, so commit your changes before pulling.

### Settings tab

You can configure your user data in the Settings tab, along with the path to the Git installation.

Locked files will appear in a list in the Settings tab. You can see who has locked a file and release file locks after you've pushed your work.
